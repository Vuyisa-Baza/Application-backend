# Application back end

This app was build as part of my honors research project. It provides a server to service the request to the database from the front end.

I decided to create separate apps for the front and back ends to make development of the application more easier

This app was built using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB as the database.

## How to run the project?

1. Clone this repository in your local system.
2. Open the command prompt from your project directory and run the command `npm install`.
3. Open the command prompt from your project directory and run the command `npm start`.
4. Go to your browser and type `http://127.0.0.1:3001/` in the address bar.
5. Hurray! That's it.
